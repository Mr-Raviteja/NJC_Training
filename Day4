Object Oriented Programming Fundamentals
------------------------------------------
What is the main difference between a class and an object?
Class is a collection of methods and members which as a blueprint where object is the instantiation of the class.
What is Encapsulation? Explain with a used case?
Binding of data into a single unit is called Encapsulation.When object is initiated the class members and member functions binded in to the object with initialised data.
What is Polymorphism? Explain with a used case?
Polymorphism is the one with many forms.

Explain Overriding & Overloading and its advantages

What is Inheritance and different types of inheritance? Explain with a used case

What is an abstract class?

What is an interface and how multiple inheritance is achieved with this

What are the access modifiers?
public,private,protected,default are access modifiers which gives security to the classes,methods,variables for accessing by using the keywords.
What are the various types of constructors?

What is ‘this’ pointer?
'this' is the keyword used for refering the current object.
What is static and dynamic Binding?
Static binding is allocated to the variables  or methods at compile time 
Dynamic binding is allocated to the variables  or methods at run time
How many instances can be created for an abstract class and why?

Which OOPS concept is used as a reuse mechanism and explain with a use case

Inheritance concept used for resue mechanism

Please identify one practical scenario for each pillar of OOPs.
